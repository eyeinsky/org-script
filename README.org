* org_script

Search and run code blocks from your org files.

Configure:
- set =ORG= environment variable to a path at which your .org files reside
- add =org_script.sh= to path (possibly aliasing it to something short)

Then, given an org file with this code block inside:
#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_src bash :script my_script
    echo Hello, my friend
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src

Then running
- =org_script.sh my_script= runs the script
- =org_script.sh show my_script= shows the contents of the script

Running bare =org_script.sh= lists all scripts it can find. When fzf
is available, it also presents a choice to run any of these.
